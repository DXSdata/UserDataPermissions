# UserDataPermissions
Corrects permissions and owner settings of Windows Redirected Folders (user profile)


# Installation
Open the project with MS Visual Studio and compile it.

Note the Settings file and change it to your needs.

Run it on the server where your redirected folders' data resides, e.g. your domain controller.


Note:
The suggested user groups in the Settings file originate from German Windows systems.
E.g. in English systems, change the group names like
- Authentifizierte Benutzer -> Authenticated Users
- ERSTELLER-BESITZER -> CREATOR-OWNER
